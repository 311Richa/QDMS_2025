    "Welcome to Tutorial 2. This tutorial is meant for users who want to learn how to use MB-Fit to construct MB-nrg-style potential energy functions for small molecules.\n",
    "We will demonstrate how to construct such potential energy functions for small organic molecule using methylamine (CH3-NH2) as an example. We will first build a model for gas-phase methylamine, and then we will expand our model to include methylamine-water interactions.\n",
    "The choice of methylamine is arbitrary, and the process outlined here should work for most small (up to 10 or so atoms) molecules."

    "Finally, in section 2.3 we will build the 3-body PEF for H2O -- H2O -- CH3-NH2.\n",
    "By combining these three PEFs, we will be able to perform molecular dynamics simulations and study solvated CH3-NH2 at near-CCSD(T) accuracy!"
